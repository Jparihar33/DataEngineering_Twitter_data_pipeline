# DataEngineering_Twitter_data_pipeline
This project sets up a data pipeline to collect and process data from Twitter using the Twitter API. Apache Airflow is used to schedule, monitor, and manage the pipeline. The pipeline pulls tweets, performs basic processing, and stores the data in a database for further analysis.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to automate the extraction of data from Twitter using their public API. We use Apache Airflow to manage the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes. The data is collected in near real-time, processed, and then stored in a database for analysis, visualization, or machine learning tasks.
